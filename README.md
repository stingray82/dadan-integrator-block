Bubble Integrator Block
=======================

This is a simple block for Gutenberg that will allow much slicker embedding of
bubbles within your WordPress site

 

Why create an integrator?
-------------------------

The native embed option is poor it includes the aync options you can modify the
embed to by pass this but its not a smooth operation and thus the integrator was
born.

 

**Native Embedded:**

**Manual Embed using the integrator and it comes in some quick input sizes as
well**

Please note there is a known issue with some FSE themes overriding the CSS of
the integrator you may need to modify your styles for your installation, i am
happy for a suggestion if anyone has one for fixing this across all FSE themes
